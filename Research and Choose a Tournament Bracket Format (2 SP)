Tournament Formats 
Single Elimination – Players are eliminated after one loss, with winners advancing to the next round until a champion is determined. 
This format is fast and efficient, making it ideal for large tournaments with limited time, but it may feel unfair since a single mistake can knock a player out.

Double Elimination – Players get a second chance after losing once, as they move to a separate "losers' bracket." 
This format provides more fairness by allowing skilled players to recover from an early loss, 
but it requires almost double the number of matches compared to Single Elimination, making it harder to schedule.

Round Robin – Every participant competes against all others at least once, and the player with the best overall record wins. 
This format ensures fairness and gives players more chances to prove their skill, but it takes much longer to complete and is best suited for small tournaments.

For the project, Single Elimination is currently the most efficient choice. It’s the simplest to implement, requires fewer matches, 
and is widely used in sports and esports tournaments. This format keeps development manageable while still providing a solid competition structure that users will recognize and understand.
